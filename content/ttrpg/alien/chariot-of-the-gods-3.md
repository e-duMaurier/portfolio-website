The creature, covered in blood, seeing itself surrounded, and the exit blocked, runs further into the bridge, up the wall and crashes through one of the air vents. Several of the Montero crew back away, while Wilson has a look at Dr. Cooper. Dr. Cooper has a rash over his hands and neck, and in his pocket, he had a syringe that contained a black liquid.

In the chaos, Cronus company agent Lori Clayton ran off screaming.

It was decided that it would be a good idea to barricade the broken air vent now, especially as there was no telling what this creature was, or where it was. Captain Miller and acting-captain Johns headed to storage, to find anything that might be useful to seal the air vent.

While they headed off, Reid kept an eye on the air vent, along with Davies, just in case the creature should come back through it. Flynn, a medic onboard the Cronus, was visibly shaken, not just because of the creature, but he could not understand why Dr. Cooper had not taken the vaccine.He explained to the Montero crew, that after the samples had been brought onboard, and crew members had been exposed, they started mutating, and so he, alongside Dr. Cooper and other scientists and medical crew, worked to produce the vaccination. They didn't have time for lengthy testing, but initially it appeared to be working, and the rest of the crew looked, and felt fine.

Flynn suggested that the Montero crew should really consider getting vaccinated, as there is no telling how much of the spores they have been exposed to. Flynn advised that there should be more vaccines available either in the med-lab or the science labs.

After Miller and Johns return to the bridge with whatever they could find, the broken air vent is patched up, then both the Montero crew, and remaining Cronus crew, make their way towards the med-lab.

A search of the initial entry room of the med-lab didn't produce anything of value, just some familiar, but old, equipment used for the care of patients. Through a small decontamination room, is the med pod room. Looking around the room, Wilson, found a small medical pouch, that contained 6 syringes, each containing a familiar black fluid, that Flynn confirmed was the vaccine.Miller, volunteered to take the vaccine first, and allowed Flynn to inject it in to her. With no visible side effects, and Miller saying she felt fine, Wilson was keeping an eye on Miller.

One of the med pods had been badly damaged, and looked like something had smashed out of it. The other was closed, and the plexiglass screen was covered on the inside, by a rust-coloured film, only allowing a silhouette of something inside the pod.

Flynn opened the pod, and inside was a creature that lay limp and had been partially dissected. A brief investigation revealed that this was once Evelyn Carter, one of the Cronus pilots. As Flynn went to close the pod again, the creature lunged forward and attacked at Flynn's throat.Some quick reactions, and well-placed shots from Davies, dropped the abomination dead.

Flynn was taken to one of the medical stations in the med lab after receiving initial treatment. Miller decided that she would go back to the Montero and retrieve some additional medical supplies, as they would be more sterile, after not being 73 years old.

Due to an unknown number of creatures on board, especially a new creature that had burst through the chest of Dr. Cooper, Davies decided to accompany her, so that she wasn't wandering the ship alone.

Davies and Miller went back aboard the Montero to get supplies, and shortly after, MU/TH/ER announced on the intercom

*“Displacement Drive malfunction, cascade failure imminent. Fission reactor overload in T-minus ten minutes.”*

In a panic, Miller went to speak with MU/TH/ER. There was no way to stop the self-destruct sequence. The umbilical would have to be disconnected, and the Montero piloted far away enough, as to not cause severe damage to the Cronus.Davies, with some quick thinking, was able to program the autopilot of the Montero so that it would turn off, fly away a little, and set the FTL drive to get the blast a safe distance away. Then Davies and Miller rushed back down the umbilical, and back aboard the Cronus.

Having provided a status update to the rest of the crew, Miller and Davies met with Wilson, Rye, and Cham back at the Cronus. Working quickly and panicked, and with the help of others, Rye managed to get the airlock door sealed tight enough, that when the Montero pulled away, the door remain sealed when the umbilical was ripped away.

Looking through the small portal, the crew watched as the Montero flew into space at speed. When it had become just a small speck in the vastness of the void and stars, the huge explosion that was seen clearly from the Cronus was the last of the Montero.

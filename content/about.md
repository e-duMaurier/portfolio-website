## Hello, I'm Emma.

I’m an experienced IT professional with over 7 years of technical support expertise and a passion for technology. My journey in the world of computers began in the mid 1980’s when we got an Acorn Electron computer, and we had to load games from cassette tapes, or type in all the code manually, copied from magazines.

That early passion never faded, and developed in to building PCs, configuring home networks and getting some basic knowledge of programming with C++ and Pascal in the late 1990’s. Since then, I’ve continued with that passion, always wanting to learn more. I’ve experienced more with programming languages C# and Java, I’ve gained a foundational understanding of virtualisation technologies, including Hyper-V, VMware ESXi & Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Proxmox.

As an Open Source enthusiast, I’ve adopted Linux as my daily operating system, have been utilising VMs on bare-metal setups, and cloud VPS to host open-source applications. My exploration of containerisation with Docker, and now starting to delve in to Kubernetes, has further enhanced my skills in this area.

I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. Developing my cyber security knowledge by taking a SOC100 course with [Level Effect](https://www.leveleffect.com/), alongside furthering my knowledge and experience with several other online platforms and resources.
